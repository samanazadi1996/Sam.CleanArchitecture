# [ASP Dotnet Core Clean Architecture](../README.md) - Removing the `Server` Header in Kestrel: Enhancing Security and Customization

In **ASP.NET Core** applications, the default web server, Kestrel, plays a vital role in handling HTTP requests and responses. By default, Kestrel includes the `Server` header in HTTP responses, which contains information about the web `server` being used. This article explores the purpose of the Server header, the reasons for removing it, and how to implement this change in your ASP.NET Core application.


## What is the Server Header?

The `Server` header is an HTTP response header that provides information about the web server that processed the request. By default, most web servers, including Kestrel, include this header in their responses. For example, an HTTP response might look like this:

```
Server: Kestrel
```
This header indicates that the response was generated by the Kestrel web server. Other servers, such as Apache or Nginx, may include similar values like Apache/2.4.41 or nginx/1.18.0.

## Why Remove the Server Header?

There are several reasons why you might want to disable the `Server` header:

1. **Enhanced Security**
    - The `Server` header can reveal details about your server's software, which could be exploited by attackers. For instance, if a specific version of Kestrel (or another server) has a known vulnerability, the presence of this header can make your application an easy target. By removing the header, you reduce the risk of exposing sensitive server information.

2. **Avoiding Unnecessary Information Disclosure**
    - The information in the `Server` header is generally not useful for end-users or client browsers. Removing this header helps streamline HTTP responses by eliminating non-essential data.

3. **Customizing HTTP Responses**
    - Developers often want complete control over the HTTP headers sent by their application. Disabling the `Server` header allows you to fully customize the headers, ensuring that your responses align with your application's needs and security policies.

## How to Remove the Server Header in ASP.NET Core

To disable the Server header in Kestrel, set the AddServerHeader property to false in the Kestrel configuration. Here's an example:

```c#
builder.WebHost.ConfigureKestrel(options =>
{
    options.AddServerHeader = false; // Disable the Server header
});
```
Explanation:
- The `ConfigureKestrel` method is used to customize the behavior of Kestrel.
- Setting `options.AddServerHeader` to `false` ensures that the `Server` header will no longer be included in HTTP responses.


## Benefits of Removing the Server Header

By disabling the Server header, you achieve several advantages:

1. **Improved Security**: Attackers have less information about your server, making it harder for them to target known vulnerabilities.

2. **Cleaner HTTP Responses**: Your responses are free from unnecessary metadata, resulting in a more professional and minimalistic design.

3. **Compliance with Security Standards**: Many organizations follow strict security policies that recommend hiding server details from HTTP responses.


## Conclusion
Removing the `Server` header from HTTP responses in Kestrel is a simple yet effective step towards enhancing the security and customization of your ASP.NET Core application. By adding the `AddServerHeader = false` configuration, you can protect your server from potential exploits and gain more control over your application's HTTP responses. This change is especially recommended for applications deployed in production environments where security is a priority.
